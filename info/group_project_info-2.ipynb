This is a group assignment, so you will also train your abilities to plan and execute data analyses collectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "Your task for this assignment is to use the python notebook to implement your analysis, process your data, and visualize and interpret the results. Then, write a report that describes the data, results and conclusions of your analysis, including informative graphs and tables. Remember that plots and other visual representations of data are very useful in conveying your conclusions. The overall evaluation criterium is **understandability**."

    " - **Maximum 12 publication units (#words/500 + #figures + #tables). No appendix or supplement. So be concise!** \n",
    " - Make the figures in a smart manner, to avoid too many plots with little information.\n",

    " - Try to relate the sections together\n",

    " ### Before Submission:\n",
    " - Make sure that from the menu you can select: \"Kernel **> Restart & Run All\" without failure. \n",
    " - Write comments for each code that you have written.\n",
    " - Submit the report in both -.ipynb- and -.html- format. If you have used additional files to what you started with, upload it all as a zip.\n",
    " - You can chooose whether you want to make a separate document (by latex, word or similar) and attach the code, or make a report in the notebook with running code and text.\n",
